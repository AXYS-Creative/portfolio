    <p>
      Hey, Iâ€™m Aaron ðŸ‘‹ a passionate designer and developer with an urge to make
      websites more user-friendly, accessible, and performant â€” key factors in
      converting traffic and business growth. Too many websites fall short when
      it comes to performance and accessibility standards. This is where I come
      in. Get started below!
